### General

The mantainer can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/dellaporta/main/edit/master/index.md) to edit and preview the content for this website made of markdown files.

Whenever a commit to this repository is done, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in this site, from the content in the markdown files.

### Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing. It includes conventions for code blocks, headers, as well as bulleted and listed text. It includes syntax for bold and italic fonts. You can refer links and images with it. 

For more details see [GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/dellaporta/main/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
